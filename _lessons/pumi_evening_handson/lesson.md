Before you begin, first [Open the Answers Form](https://goo.gl/forms/HmuX6HrT0Yfoz7ny2){:target="\_blank"}
in a separate browser tab/window.
**Answer Question 0** once you have it open.
We will be entering responses to questions here that are placed throughout the
lesson.

The MFEM+PUMI examples are prepared for execution on Cooley at ALCF.
Except where noted, all commands shown below should be executed in a terminal
logged into Cooley.
In each new terminal first prepare your environment by running the commands
listed in the following section.

Note, each step can be performed independently; we encourage you to go
through them in order though.  If there are issues running the examples, or you
wish to skip ahead you will find the execution output in the `expectedOutput`
directory.

## To begin this lesson

- Ensure that your environment is only using the `@default` packages by running the following commands:
```
cp ~/.soft ~/.soft_bk
echo '@default' > ~/.soft
resoft
mv ~/.soft_bk ~/.soft
```

- Add mvapich2 to your environment
```
soft add +mvapich2-2.3rc1
```

- Copy the example directory to your home directory
```
rsync -aP {{site.handson_install_root}}/mfem-pumi-lesson ~/.
```

- Enter the lesson directory
```
cd ~/mfem-pumi-lesson
```


## Geometric Model Defeaturing

Geometric models are often provided by design engineers and include many
features that are not required for simulation.
The left side of Figure 1 depicts the geometric model of a Tokamak fusion
reactor that has multiple bolts, nuts, and brackets that have no influence on
the frequency analysis.
These features are removed from the Parasolid CAD model by the Simmetrix
SimModSuite tools by calling Parasolid kernel APIs to delete the faces and
'heal' the remaining hole via extensions of the bounding edges and faces.
The right side of Figure 1 depicts the defeatured Tokamak model.
In a model with this level of complexity that engineers and scientists running
the simulation often must coordinate to create the `as-simulated' model.

*Figure 1. Initial (left) and defeatured (right) Tokamak antenna geometric model*

For this hands-on we will perform a few simple defeaturing operations on the RPI
Formula Hybrid suspension upright shown in Figure 3.
The ids of the geometric model faces of interest are labelled.
Faces ## ## ## are small faces created during the design that are not relevant
to the simulation and can be removed.
To remove those faces run the following commands.

```
qsub -I -n 1 -t 30 -A ATPESC2018 -q training
cd ~/mfem-pumi-lesson/defeature
```

*Figure 4. RPI Formula Hybrid suspension upright with small faces removed*

In the Mesh Generation step we will generate and compare meshes of the initial
and defeatured geometric models.


### Optional - Run SimModeler to defeature the upright.
Launch the VNC. Run SimModeler. FIXME

## Problem Definition

We will define a tensile loading on the upright by applying a uniform force on
one end (min Z face) and fixing the displacements on the other end (max Z face).
All other geometric model faces will be unconstrained.  No body forces are
applied.

Using geometric classification of the mesh we can define the boundary conditions
on the geometric model without having any knowledge/consideration of the mesh.
A very simple text based interface was defined for this demonstration example to
define the two boundary conditions.  To specify the geometric model faces with
the load applied we add one line with `Load` followed by another line with the
number of faces with that load applied.  The geometric model face ids, one per
line, are then listed. Using the same convention we define the fixed faces using
the string `Dirichlet`, the number of listed faces, then the list of face ids.
The boundary condition specification for this example is listed below.
Using the geometric model classification mechanism supports creation of more
feature-rich interfaces (command line, file, GUI).

```
$ cat upright.def
Dirichlet
1
43

Load
1
344
```

**Answer Question 1**

## Mesh Generation

Now that we have prepared the model and defined the boundary conditions we can
proceed with mesh generation using the Simmetrix SimModSuite library APIs.
The mesh generation procedures are driven by size controls (e.g., the absolute
length of mesh edges) defined by the user on geometric model entities or defined
within geometric primatives that intersect the model (e.g., cubes, spheres,
cylinders, etc.).
The mesh generator is automated, which in the domain of mesh generation means
that it will always produce a valid mesh while doing its best to respect the
user specified controls.
Note, the features of the geometric model highly dictate what mesh sizes are
possible.
Specifically:
- the mesh topology must exactly respect the geometric model topology, 
i.e., each geometric model vertex has at least one mesh vertex classied on it.
- the geometry of the mesh (e.g., the position of the vertices or curvature of
faces) is *always* an approximation to the geometric model.

Once the mesh is generated we convert it, in-memory (i.e., using PUMI and
SimModSuite APIs), to a PUMI mesh and then write the PUMI mesh to file.

**Answer Question 2**

```
qsub -I -n 1 -t 30 -A ATPESC2018 -q training
cd ~/mfem-pumi-lesson/meshGeneration
# generate the mesh on the initial geometric model and create paraview vtu files
./generate --native-model=upright.x_t upright.smd 5kg1
./render upright.x_t 5kg1/ 5kg1_initial_vtu
# generate the mesh on the defeatured model and create paraview vtu files
./generate upright_defeatured_geomsim.smd 5kg1
./render upright_defeatured_geomsim.smd 5kg1/ 5kg1_defeatured_vtu
```

### Optional - Visualize the Initial Meshes
Download the `.*vtu` files from [Here - FIXME](https://goo.gl/forms/HmuX6HrT0Yfoz7ny2), or
use a file transfer utility (e.g., `scp`, `rsync`, `putty`, etc.) to copy them to your local machine.

## Partitioning

Efficient parallel execution requires equally distributing the units of work among the
processing resources while keeping communication costs low.
The multi-level graph and recursive sectioning geometric methods are among the
most commonly available and used methods for partitioning unstructured meshes.
In this lesson we will exercise the multi-level graph partitioner (refered to as
'graph' below) provided by the Zoltan interface and implemented by ParMETIS.
We will then run recursive inertial bisection ('RIB') to produce meshes with
the same part count (number of sub-domains), and compare the results.
Both partitioners are targeting an imbalance of 5%; defined as the max element
count on any part divided by the average element count across all parts.

```
qsub -I -n 1 -t 30 -A ATPESC2018 -q training
cd ~/mfem-pumi-lesson/partition
mpirun -np 4 ./ptnParma upright_defeatured_geomsim.smd 5kg1_defeatured/ 5kg1_p4_parmetis/ 4 parmetis kway 0  &> graph.out
mpirun -np 4 ./ptnParma upright_defeatured_geomsim.smd 5kg1_defeatured/ 5kg1_p4_rib/ 4 rib ptn 0 &> rib.out
#render the partitions
mpirun -np 4 ./render upright_defeatured_geomsim.smd 5kg1_p4_parmetis/ 5kg1_p4_parmetis_vtu/
mpirun -np 4 ./render upright_defeatured_geomsim.smd 5kg1_p4_rib/ 5kg1_p4_rib_vtu/
```

The entity imbalance information is listed on the lines containing `entity
imbalance <v e f r>:`.
The imbalance values follow the definition given above (`max count/avg count`);
i.e., 5% imbalance will be listed as `1.05`.

The number mesh entities that are shared with other processes is indirectly
indicated on the lines containing `weighted TYPE <tot max min avg>` where `TYPE`
is `vtx`, `edge`, or `face`.
If the total (`tot`) or average (`avg`) number of entities of a given TYPE is
larger relative to another partition then that partition has more replicated
entities.

Given the values of the imbalance and shared entity count for each partition
(RIB, graph) above, the content of the `[graph|rib].out` files, and
Figures 6-7 below, **Answer Question 3**.

*Figure 6. RIB partition*
*Figure 7. ParMETIS multi-level graph partition*

### Optional - Visualize the Partitioned Meshes
Download the `*vtu` files from [Here]( https://goo.gl/forms/HmuX6HrT0Yfoz7ny2), or
use a file transfer utility (e.g., `scp`, `rsync`, `putty`, etc.) to copy them
to your local machine.
